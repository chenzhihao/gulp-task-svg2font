#my gulpfile scaffold

Compile svg to font and output its sass file by:
```js
    gulp iconfont
```

The ``/dest/fonts`` folder will has the fonts files.

The ``src/styles/icon`` folder will has the file sass file "``_iconfont.scss``". Then you can use your own sass task to compile them into your css.
